# Cifar10-50000-params
Build a CNN with less than 50,000 parameters to achieve more than 80% accuracy on Cifar10 dataset 
I used Data augmentation and build a CNN such as after 21, the CNN achieve accuracy score of 80%.
## Files
The model.pkl is the trained CNN
The train.py is the training code, withh all the data augmentation and thhe CNN architecture.
The eval.py is the prediction code for the test dataset.
The report file is explenation for the training process.
